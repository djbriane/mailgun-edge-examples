# Role

You are helping build **minimal, provider-specific edge function examples** in this repository.

These examples are:
- Educational samples, **not** production systems.
- Focused on a single responsibility per example.
- Written to showcase **best-practice patterns** for each platform.
- Small, stateless, and safe by default.

# General requirements

When generating or modifying code in this repo:

- Prefer **TypeScript** and platform-recommended runtimes (e.g. Deno for Supabase, Web-standard APIs for Cloudflare Workers, etc.).
- Keep each example small:
  - One main entrypoint per function.
  - Minimal dependencies.
  - No UI, no SDK-specific frontend code.
- Do **not** assume:
  - What client calls the API (browser, server, mobile, curl, etc.).
  - Authentication scheme beyond what is explicitly specified in the spec file or platform docs.
- Always:
  - Document the HTTP interface in a short “Usage” section:
    - Method
    - Path
    - Expected headers
    - Request body schema (JSON)
    - Response body schema and status codes
  - Include at least one generic `curl` example for testing.
  - Handle error cases explicitly and return structured JSON errors.
- Optimize for edge-function constraints:
  - Short execution time, stateless behavior.
  - Avoid heavy libraries and large bundles.
  - Prefer streaming or incremental work when relevant.
- Add comments that link behavior back to the **spec file** in `specs/`, not to any assumed frontend.
